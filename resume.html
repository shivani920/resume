                <h3>Phone Pay Website</h3>
                <p>
                    A responsive website designed for PhonePay, an Indian mobile
                    payment service provider. The website is
                    built using ReactJS library and Redux as the state
                    management tool. It provides features like making
                    payments, viewing transaction history, adding beneficiaries
                    etc. I worked on this project
                    during my internship at DJTech.

                <h3>Online Task management Project</h3>
                <p>
                    This is a simple task management system where users can
                    create accounts, add tasks, assign them to
                    other users, mark them as completed or delete them.
                    Authentication is done through JWT tokens.
                    The server side code is written in NodeJs and Express
                    framework while the client side uses ReactJS
                    and Redux.
